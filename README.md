JWriter Word Proccessor for Jacobeau Project




Rich  text editor:    Italics, bold, underline

Its like a text editor with Tactical Vission for Color Coordination


Cusotm Markup;
EX if sentances ewnds with == and ===  then it tunrs into a highlighted thing
Stuff with keyboard short up

Organization

-Green = I like
-Yellow = part of Outline
-Red = not working


Group all the stuff together


Toggle On/Off the highlights







Other Stuff
-Push other button,  then each day that things was written, get shown
  like by wrtittng session,   or version history

-Auto detect Verb-Tense
 (you swtiched from past tense to present tense and blah blah)

-Analyize sentance lenghts
   show if one sentances is outlyer in length
   average sentance length is this
   What percentage of descriptive words are germanic or French


Collaspable Text Blocks
    like in VS code
    have a side arrow that can be clicked and collapse a paragraph
    tell the beggin and end with special symbols, like  {{        }}




Reasearch:
Scrivener  -  program for bookwritters, look it up and see what they have

yWriter    - program that a write made in Delphi code

there has got to be soem kind of open source text editor we can rip off








Ideas for distinctions

-Character Desripction
-Scene Desription

then with all these type,  there should be a percentage representation of how much of the total words, the Type makes up









Ideas on How to Do this:

-Use meta data behind the text to tell what kind of Type it is
